/** The different types of attacks.
 *  SIMPLE: the enemy shoots a single bullet at a time
 *  CONTACT: the enemy doesn't shoot, but hurts on contact.
 *  RANGED: the enemy's attack has a limited range. If paired
 *          with CONTACT, means the attack is "dashing", and
 *          the dash triggers withing range (use -1 for "infinite").
 *          __Note__: the "dashing" attack logic is actually performed 
 *          by ai_follow_dash, independently from attack.type;
 *          however, one must also specify this in attack.type so
 *          that the attack sound is played correctly (i.e. when
 *          the enemy starts dashing rather than when he contacts
 *          the player).
 *  BLOCKING: standalone, means that the enemy shoots continuously
 *            and stops moving while shooting; paired with SIMPLE,
 *            means the enemy shoots a single bullet and stops for
 *            `attack.blockTime` after shooting.
 *  AXIS_BOUND: the bullet travels along axes, therefore its instance
 *              will be an AxisBullet.
